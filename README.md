# Customer Churn Prediction with Machine Learning

## Introduction
This project aims to predict customer churn in a telecommunications company using machine learning techniques. The dataset used is sourced from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/blastchar/telco-customer-churn).

## Installation
- Python 3.x
- Libraries: pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, scikit-learn, xgboost, catboost, tensorflow, etc.

## Usage
1. Clone the repository.
2. Install the required dependencies.
3. Run the Jupyter notebook or Python script to train and evaluate the models.

## Data Preprocessing
- Handled missing data and encoded categorical variables.
- Standardized numerical features using StandardScaler.

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Discovered insights about customer churn using visualizations.
- Found correlations between features and churn.

## Model Training
- Trained multiple machine learning models, including Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, AdaBoost, and Neural Networks.
- Evaluated models based on accuracy and selected the Random Forest model for its high performance.

## Model Evaluation
- Achieved an accuracy of X% with the Random Forest model.
- Provided classification reports for each model.

## Deployment
- Considerations for deploying the model in a production environment are discussed.

## Conclusion
This project demonstrates the effectiveness of machine learning in predicting customer churn, which can help businesses in retaining their customers and improving customer satisfaction.
